This project has been split into 2 new github projects under our corporate account.

* [CafeTownsend :: Sencha ExtJS, Touch, DeftJS, & WASI FlowMVC](https://github.com/WebAppSolutionInc/sencha-cafe-townsend) - 
This project is an HTML5/Javascript implementation of the infamous CafeTownsend application. CafeTownsend is a well 
known application created to demonstrate various MVC frameworks using Flex or ActionScript. There are known ports 
using Cairngorm, Mate, PureMVC, Spring ActionScript, RobotLegs and Swiz. This implementation uses Sencha Touch, 
Sencha ExtJS, DeftJS, FlowMVC, Jasmine, LocaleManager, and some others...

* [WASI's FlowMVC](https://github.com/WebAppSolutionInc/flow-mvc) - FlowMVC builds on the work of DeftJS, Sencha ExtJS, 
and Sencha Touch APIs with extensions that enable Flex and ActionScript developers to take their expertise and apply 
them to the HTML5/JavaScript world. It's a framework that users of Flex MVC-based architectures, such as Swiz or 
Parley, will be familiar with.
