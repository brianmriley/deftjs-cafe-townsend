/**
 * The mediator essentially fulfills the passive view pattern for a given view -- acts like a view controller,
 * but chose to use the suffix Mediator simply to distinguish it from application controllers that interact with
 * services and models.
 *
 * Handles view events, typically generated from user gestures, manipulates the view with animations, transitions,
 * and/or dynamically building components within the view, and works with the views  API (again with events)
 * but also by way of getters and setters in order to bind data to and from the view.
 *
 * Currently the abstract mediator doesn't provide much in terms of base functionality as it extends from the
 * base controller (since we're really relying on Sencha MVC infrastructure where a controller knows how to
 * interact with a given view); the basic global event bus functionality is currently implemented in the
 * base, abstract controller as well.
 *
 * Consider using DeftJS here so a mediator is created and destroyed with it's accompanying view. The other issue
 * we'll run into without DeftJS view controller support is that currently the controller's (and hence all mediators)
 * are singletons -- we really want the ability to create a unique mediator instance for each view.
 *
 * TODO: BMR: 02/22/13: Find a way to bake the view into this class automatically.
